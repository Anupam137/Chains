## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the use of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for chaining runnables in machine learning applications. It provides examples of different types of chains and how to utilize them effectively.

## Key Sections

### 1. Langchain Expression Language Basics
- **Chaining Runnables**: Any two runnables can be chained together into sequences using the pipe operator or the `.pipe()` method.
- **Types of LCEL Chains**:
  - SequentialChain
  - Parallel Chain
  - Router Chain
  - Chain Runnables
  - Custom Chain (Runnable Sequence)

### 2. Chaining Runnables
- Explanation of how to combine multiple runnables to create more complex chains.
- Examples of generating outputs and analyzing their complexity.

### 3. Code Examples
- **Creating a ChatOllama Instance**: Shows how to create an instance of `ChatOllama` for generating responses.
- **Generating Responses**: Examples of using templates to generate responses about various topics, such as the solar system.

### 4. Parallel LCEL Chain
- Description of how parallel chains work to run multiple runnables simultaneously.
- Example outputs demonstrating the characteristics of the solar system.

### 5. Advanced Chain Examples
- **Conditional Chains**: Demonstrates how to create chains with conditional logic.
- **Loops in Chains**: Shows how to create chains with loops for repetitive tasks.

### 6. Best Practices for Chain Development
- **Modularizing Chains**: Tips for breaking down complex chains into smaller, reusable components.
- **Testing and Debugging Chains**: Strategies for identifying and fixing issues in chain development.

### 7. Use Cases. Real-World Applications of LCEL Chains
- **Natural Language Processing**: Examples of using LCEL chains for NLP tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
